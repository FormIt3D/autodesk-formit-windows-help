# Scenes

![](../.gitbook/assets/animations-aerial.gif)

Use scenes and animations to help you steer walkthroughs and tell a visual story. You can save a scene viewpoint and its related visual and layer states. Add an animation and nest scenes under it to modify transitions, pauses, and camera speed.
