# Create Panorama

In addition to the In Sketch view camera options available, FormIt can export a Panorama image for 3D viewing of your sketch in an external viewer.  This option is available from the View menu.

Selecting this option will generate a full 360 degree image from the current camera view.  The width of the image can be modified and the mode can be toggled between Cylindrical and Spherical panorama.

Save the file, and load it in your favorite 3D viewer.
