# Model Statistics

The Model Statistics palette provides a way to view statistics of your FormIt model.  Overall model  statistics are displayed followed by statistics for each Group, identified as a History.&#x20;

Enable the Model Statistics palette by going to the Window menu and checking the box next to Model Statistics:

If you want to see changes in your statistics after making some changes in you model you can Refresh again.

If you open a new file, you will need to click the Refresh button to generate the statistics for the new model, even if you are Watching (see below).

## Watching

If you want your model statistics to update as you edit your model, click the Watch button:

Note that using Watch can cause model performance to slow, especially in a large model.
