To draw a circle, first, choose the center point and then specify the circle radius. Next, the circle automatically becomes a face.

## Editing a Circle

You can also modify a circle you have already placed by right-clicking it and choosing Edit Circle at the bottom:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/EditCircle1.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Edit Circle grips will appear, allowing you to change the size or orientation of the circle.  The new circle will appear as an outline while editing.

You'll see a few grips appear:

* The center grip controls the origin of the circle
* The grip along the edge controls the radius of the circle
* The grip at the top controls the normal/orientation of the circle

To complete the edit, exit the tool by clicking into empty space or hitting ESC.  The new circle will replace the current circle.
