# Measure Angle

The Measure Angle tool is located on the [Tool Bar](../formit-introduction/tool-bars.md).

The Measure Angle tool is used to measure angles between vertices, edges, faces, and volumes. You can also use the Measure Angle tool to drive dimensions of geometry.

*   From the **Measure** toolbar menu, select the **Measure Angle** tool or use the keyboard shortcut **M A** and select a starting point.
