# 1.3 - 3D Sketch and Drag Face

_We are ready to start drawing the Farnsworth house! 3D modeling in FormIt at its core consists of drawing lines to create faces and then dragging those faces to create volumes._

‌ _If you did not complete the last section, download and open the_ _**1.3 - 3D Sketch and Drag Face.axm**_ _file from the_ _**FormIt Primer Part 1 Datasets**._

## **Draw Faces with Lines**

1 – To facilitate the modeling process, you can use the **Floating Navigation Toolbar** to switch between different views modes. For this exercise, we recommend using the **Perspective (VP)** and **3D View (V3).**

2 – Newly created geometry will automatically join or “stick to” any existing ungrouped geometry it touches. To avoid this, you will typically want to organize your geometry with groups. To create a group from the floor plan, select the rectangle by double-clicking it, then right-click to access the **Context Menu** and select **Group (G).**

3 – When tracing the plan we don’t want the lines to snap to the grid, so click on **Settings** in the **Main Menu** and unchecking **Snap to Grid (SG).**

4 – To start drawing, click the **Create Sketch** (Pencil) icon in the **Standard Toolbar** and choose the **Line tool (L)**.

5 - Let's start by creating a rectangle on the imported image. To create the first line:

1. While in the **Line tool**, click near **the upper left corner** of the upper terrace in the imported sketch.
2. Move your mouse along the red axis that appears.
3. Click the **Tab** key to input the dimension: **77'-4 1\8".**

_**Note:** Anytime a temporary dimension appears while sketching, you can either press_ _**Tab** or just start typing a number_ _to open the_ _**Dimension Dialog**._

6 – To create the second line, move your mouse down along the green axis and enter **28’-8**” for the upper terrace’s short edge.

7 - To define the rectangle’s third edge and finish:

1. Move your mouse along the red axis and hold down the **Shift** key. The red axis line will thicken to indicate that the line is locked to this axis.
2. While the **Shift key** is pressed - move your mouse to the first point you drew. Click to commit the endpoint.
3. The third point will automatically be set, parallel to the red - axis defined by (A) - and the green axis - defined by (B).
4. Finally, to finish enclosing the rectangle, release the **Shift** key and click back on the first point you drew. Press **Esc** twice to exit the sketch tool.

_**Note:**_ _The red and green axes keep you parallel and perpendicular to the grid. When you draw a line off the world axes, a purple axis line will allow you to stay 90 degrees relative to your off-axis line._

## **Drag the Face to Create Volume**

1 - Single-click inside the outline you just drew to select the face. You are now automatically in the **Drag Face** tool.

2 - Single-click again to start the dragging. Move your mouse upwards (along the positive Z-axis) to extrude a volume in that direction. Start typing **12'-2"**, and a dimension box will appear with this value, then hit **Enter**.

_**Note:**_ _A_ _single-click_ _will select just a single face, whereas a_ _double-click_ _will select all (ungrouped) adjacent edges and faces._

## **3D Sketching with Arc, Spline, and Circle**

_The following exercise is not critical to finishing the house. However, it will allow you to experiment with some of the other 3D Sketching tools available. Click_ _**here**_ _to learn more about 3D sketching with World Axes._

1 - Select the **Arc by three arc points (A)** tool. Click to define the start, and then the endpoint. The third click defines the arc's radius.

2 - Select the **Spline (S)** tool. Click to define any number of points to draw a spline.

3 - Select the **Circle (C)** tool. Hover and click to define the circle's center point. Click and drag or enter a dimension to define the radius.
