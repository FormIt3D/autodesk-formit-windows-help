# Collaboration

FormIt allows multiple users (on any combination of Windows, iOS or Web clients) to collaboratively edit a FormIt model â€“ while seeing all of their changes in real time. Work simultaneously with others on the same sketch or share your work later.

**Note:** Collaboration is only available after you activate FormIt Pro. Clicking on the Collaboration icon will prompt you to log in with an Autodesk account entitled for FormIt Pro.
