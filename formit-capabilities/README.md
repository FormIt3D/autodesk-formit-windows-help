## FormIt Capabilities

Create conceptual building designs with a powerful built-in solid modeling system, incredible visualization options, and a native Dynamo integration, all while initiating a BIM workflow.

Use Autodesk速 FormIt速 to capture building design concepts when ideas occur. Take advantage of accurate and easy solid modeling, organize your ideas in Groups and Layers, and get real-world site information, such as satellite images, to correctly orient and analyze your designs with shadows, Solar Analysis, and Energy Analysis. Move your preliminary designs to centralized data storage for access and refinement in Autodesk速 Revit速 software or other software.
